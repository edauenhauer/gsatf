# GSATF Web app

I am porting this program to a web app in order to increase access an improve maintainability.

I am currently working on re-writing the parser in JavaScript, and will hopefully be integrating interactivity via AngularJS once the parser is complete.

The web app will likely be a bit more robust than the desktop app, and probably less buggy.  I also hope that hosting it will encourage more people to use it.
